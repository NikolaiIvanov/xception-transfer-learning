# Transfer learning with Xception architecture in Keras

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with code described in this post: https://habrahabr.ru/post/347564/

To reproduce experiment:
1. Download dataset from Kaggle
2. Place it under data/train_raw
3. Create directories
    - test/cats
    - test/dogs
    - train/cats
    - train/dogs
    - validation/cats
    - validation/dogs
4. Run data-preparation.ipynb to split dataset
5. Run transfer-learning.ipynb
